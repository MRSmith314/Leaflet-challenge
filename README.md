# Leaflet-challenge
This Challenge uses both HTML and JavaScript to create visulaization of Earthquake data.

# Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The task for this challenge is to visualize the earthquake data in a way that identifies the location, magnitude and depth of each earthquake occurring in the past 30 days.

Using the JSON data retrieved from the USGS GeoJSON a map is created and markers plotted to identify each earthquake with the relevant information when a point is clicked. A legend is included for depth color reference.
